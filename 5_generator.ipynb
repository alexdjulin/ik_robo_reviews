      "  - best value, good batteries. it's probably the best value for aa batteries out there. they function as expected.\n",
      "  - they're batteries. they do what batteries . they're batteries.they do what batteries are suppose to do.\n",
      "  - good buy these batteries work just fine and reasonably priced\n",
      "  - great batteries for a great price awesome batteries for an awesome price. i will never buy any other brand of battery's from now on they work great and last very long . i use the batteries for my kindle firestick remote so not sure how long they last in other things but they lasted almost a year in my remote before running out of battery\n",
      "  - repeat buy long lasting product good bang for your buck.\n",
      "  - you can never have too many aa batteries. i have so many devices that require aa batteries. this was a great deal. these batteries last nearly as well as any i've ever used.\n",
      "  - last longer than any alkaline i have purchased. performance alkaline batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEUTRAL REVIEWS:\n",
      "  - they do not last long these do not last long. i will stick to kirkland or duracell from now on. i usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since i started using these, it is every other month. disappointing.\n",
      "  - good for a quick fix these are good if you're broke and just need to get by. they work, but like other reviewers are saying, they don't last as long as other brands or rechargeable batteries. if you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less.\n",
      "  - ho-hum longevity not lasting very long. i read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. in comparison to duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. i find that both the aa and aaa are sub-par in longevity. perhaps that is the way i use them but i really expected more.\n",
      "  - three stars these are not comparable to duracell, but it's cheap\n",
      "  - good product, just not very convenient very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. unfortunately, they don't come in their own container to keep them together after opening. this means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEGATIVE REVIEWS:\n",
      "  - very disappointed my mother in law owns a home decor store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. we ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. she then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. really disappointing and a huge hassle for her. have never had batteries last such a short time. we were very unhappy.\n",
      "  - i wouldn't buy these again. they're not a bad value (because they're cheap), but they drain much faster than you would like. i hate throwing dead batteries away anyway (no recycling options here) and 4 of these drained in a day, running a tiny string of led christmas lights.\n",

      "  - awesome batteries! i'm not going to go into a great deal of detail about these batteries. other reviewers here have done a fantastic job of doing that. instead, i'm going to talk about the quality of amazon's basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. my son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. i can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. time and time again we keep coming back to the amazonbasics aa performance batteries. they have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as i can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. the biggest difference is in price. where else are you going to get 48 quality aa batteries for 11 just buy them! you won't regret it.\n",
      "  - happy camper seems to work well i haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems\n",
      "  - fantastic!!!! am amazed at how well i'm loving your batteries, amazom. i have been a loyal duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. would give them 10 stars if you allowed me.\n",
      "  - would recommend if you use alot of batterys. 48 batterys for only 15 very good deal!!! nice batterys also work perfectly.\n",
      "  - five stars excellent price, good long-lasting batteries. no complaints at all.\n",
      "  - five stars great price for so many batteries good quality\n",
      "  - why spend on name brands so far these batteries are performing well and the price was unbeatable too.\n",
      "  - works just like the name brand, without the name brand prices. works well for the price point and is completely comparable to name brand batteries. i will be purchasing all of my future battery needs from amazon basics.\n",

      "  - not what i was looking for but they are ok.\n",
      "  - three stars i'm super charged over the price of these batteries!!!!\n",
      "  - these are not rechargeable, even though they look similar to those. this battery is fine, but i purchased it because i thought it was rechargeable. shame on me for not noticing, but i thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones i had purchased before. i bought it on prime day for about 6, so i thought i was just getting a great deal.disappointing. i don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our thomas trains and other toys. i wish i had noticed the difference.\n",
      "  - logo doesnt last. good part though good knob. looks good. logo faded/wore off in a few months though. logo is kinda why i bought this, so.\n",
      "\n",
      "NEGATIVE REVIEWS:\n",
      "  - i ordered these mainly to use in a set of small led flashlights. i tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. i double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. i tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. amazon sent me a second set free of charge. they still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (i tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) so it was hit and miss with these aaa batteries--2 sets of them. i've used amazon aa with no problems.\n",
      "  - ok but they don't last long at all batteries die very quickly. spend the extra for better batteries.\n",
