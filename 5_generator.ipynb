      "  - fun little gadget took awhile to get it all setup. after getting it all setup it was fun to play with for awhile than it was just okay. have to get the wording just right to listen to radio stations or it tells you can't find it or plays something totally different. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - complicating i love my device but wish there was more of a descriptive summary of how to get music stations and as well as other features. i've learned most by just coming upon things. needs better operating instructions i don't recommend this product.\n",
      "  - limited options i feel like it plays the same playlist every time. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - functionality echo was easy to set up. speaker is not as good as the google home. both the nest thermostat and the inseon hub seem to be working okay with the echo.3 stars because i have not used all the functions yet. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - amazing for music but terrible for information. alexa works great for listening to spotifly (only if you have premium) and very basic information (time, weather). she has a tough time answering questions. this is not a google machine. she consistently would not understand simple questions. the volume is very loud and can be adjusted manually or through voice. she also can learn skills which some are hit and miss. i'd still recommend this product if you have a smart home (smart outlets, locks) or if you have spotifly premium. i recommend this product.\n",

      "  - so smart i like the ease of this electronic. she helps me everyday i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - own 1, bought 2 more as gifts infinitely useful. we use it most to explore amazon's vasr music library i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - great music player if you have amazon prime. fun for the whole family. alexia tells funny jokes for kids, answers questions on almost every subject and provides lots of musical choices. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - finally a woman that does not talk back unbelievable sound from a single source. now i can simply say what music i want, the volumne and timer are a great feature. she reads to me and answers most questions. she even tells worse jokes than me. this has enhanced my bleek life. i can turn on lights and tv when i couldn't before. it gives me freedom over my environment. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - great awesome speaker and home automation control. very recommended. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - hopefully more experience will helpl i'm not sure who needs more experience.alexa or me. after one month, the echo has been a little fickle. at times it's providing excellent service in answering questions, and there's other times that it doesn't understand the question. maybe it's how we're are asking or it's not programmed to be intelligent enough. more time will tell. all in all, we're having fun with alexa. i recommend this product.\n",

      "NEUTRAL REVIEWS:\n",
      "  - i think i should bought the google home the eco is great if your a lists person or want to order pizza. yes it can control lights and locks but it doesn't support my remote lights i have now. the eco just can't answer technical home work questions like the google can i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - technology luxury need to explain all required' hookups' to less non technical elderly people for sure. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - great for only certain things if you enjoy music do not buy, you cannot send a bluetooth signal out to an external speaker. she is not as smart as siri and answers basic basic questions. i deal with it because i bought the wemo fixtures for lights and switches and she works fine with those. i would recommend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud i don't recommend this product.\n",
      "  - not quite what i was expecting i was very interested in the echo and respective echo dot based on potential functionality. while there are some good qualities, the overall voice automation and functionality haven't lived up to the hype yet. pros: sound quality for music is fantastic, kids enjoy asking alexa questions, overall family fun. cons: even after a full month of learning my voice, alexa continues to frequently answer \"i don't know what you are asking\", at random times, alexa will start talking without any prompt, setting up additional controllable items and syncing are not as easy as amazon would have you believe, and worst experience.every time an amazon echo commercial comes on tv to promote the product, my alexa replies to the tv commercial as if it were me saying \"alexa.\" i don't recommend this product.\n",

      "  - this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing i dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though i have a prime membership, all music is not available , i had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though i upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so i dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it. i recommend this product.\n",

      "  - amazon echo show very easy to set up and use. really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - worth the extra bucks first bought the dot to see if we liked it. we enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. when i saw that the show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. now we have the dot in the bedroom and the show in the living room. for larger rooms the show is a great choice. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - great product! we use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚äôs the video feed. super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!! i recommend this product.\n",

      "  - just an average alexa option. does show a few things on screen but still limited. i don't recommend this product.\n",
      "  - echo show is easy to set up. i got this to work with my arlo pro camera, and it works well. i am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command. i hate that i cannot get my samsung tv to come on with a verbal request. i guess i will have to buy the plug for it. this was very easy to set up. downloaded the app, and plugged it in, viola it walks you through the setup. i recommend this product.\n",
      "  - works well -but the echo show works well, but at this time it cannot connect to youtube. maybe when amazon wakes up the connection will be returned. i recommend this product.\n",
